# Ricky McGeehan CV App
This single-page application, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Material-UI](https://mui.com/), serves as an interactive CV. It has been designed and created to showcase some of my web development skills and to help people to get in touch.

## Responsive UI
This application is suitable for all screen sizes and will responsively adjust to make the best use of space whilst still offering a pleasing aesthetic. Please have a play with a few different screen sizes and/or devices to see for yourself!

## Accessibility
This application has been created with accessibility in mind. It follows the WCAG 2.1 guidelines and has been assessed using [Accessibility Insights for Web](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse).
